# DB Documents
### Users:
```yaml
users:
- user_id: '<uuid>'
  name: string # optional
  surname: string # optional
  address: string # optional
  profile_picture: image # optional
  email: 'example@email.com'
  email_verified: boolean

  groups: ['group1', 'group2', 'group3']
```

### Projects:
```yaml

- project_id: 'provided or autogenerated'
  display_name: 'Example App'
  description: '(optional)'
  color: '#000000'
  terms_conditions: 'url of terms and conditions'
  logo: image
```
Project data could be created only by users with `admin` or `manager` group.

An existent project could only be modified by users with `admin`, `manager`, `<project-id>:admin` or `<project-id>:manager` group.

### Credentials:
Each project has it's list of credentials. A single credential defines a
way to obtain an access token.

```yaml
credentials:
- id_project: '<uuid>'
  type: 'public or confidential'
  client_id: ''
  client_password: ''
```

### Scopes:
Scopes are the custom fields added to a JWT. When a JWT request arrives,
the parameter `scope` it's provided by the user.

When the JWT is generated each scope that matches the user provided `scope` adds
the respective `grant` to the JWT.

If groups is not null, the user groups are also checked before adding the grants to the
JWT.

```yaml
scopes:
- pattern: '<project-id>:(.*):(.*)'
  groups: ['admin'] # optinal list
  grant:
    access:
    - type: "repository"
      name: \1
      actions: [ \2 ]
```
